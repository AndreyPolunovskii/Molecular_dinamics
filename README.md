# Molecular_dinamics

This program allow to simulate the dynamics of a system of interacting particles.

The calculation of particle coordinates, velocities and accelerations is performed on GPU.

For use this program you must install:

CUDA library , openGL, GLUT, gnuplot, cmake (version not lower then 3.1) 

All necessary parameters are set in the file:
 
 Molecular_dinamics_with_openGL_and_CUDA/include/parameters.h
 
 
To run the program in the folder Molecular_dinamics_with_openGL_and_CUDA execute the following command:

                 
                 ./RUN
